Computer Graphics Project 1: Transformations

http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~turk/cs3451_2014_spring/hw1/hw1.html

Objective

The goal of this assignment is to write the routines that allow a user to transform and view 3D graphical objects. In particular, you will write the routines for creating line drawings of both orthographic and perspective scenes. You will use Processing to write all of this code. The transformation routines that you create will implement a matrix stack and will allow you to arbitrarily rotate, translate and scale an object. To make this assignment easier, routines will be provided for you that implement line clipping and line drawing. The images that you create for this exercise will be three dimensional line drawings of scenes with no hidden surfaces or filled polygons. All of the lines will be uniformly white so that you will not need to perform color interpolation.
